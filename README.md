In this project, we aim to detect 7 different emotions from speech signals using various
feature extractors like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma using classification models
like Deep Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

# To run the code:
$ cd /required_directory

$ git clone https://github.com/sanika-karwa/Emotion-Recognition-using-Speech.git

Requirements:
Software or Library | Version
------- | ---------
Python | 3.6 or greater
Numpy | 1.18.2
Pandas | 1.0.3
Seaborn | 0.10.0
Matplotlib | 3.2.1

Datasets Used:
1. RAVDESS
2. TESS 

The MFCC's of both the datasets are combined and stored in the datasets_combined folder.
The extracted features are stored in the features folder.
The pre-trained models can be used for testing the model.
